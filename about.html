        Hi, I'm Cameron! I am a senior at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, majoring in 
        Computer Engineering with a minor in the Hoeft Technology & Management Program. With a 
        strong background in both technical and educational roles, I have interned at Northrop 
        Grumman as a Software Systems Engineer, focusing on automation, data analysis, and system 
        simulations. I have over five years of tutoring experience, including two years at 
        Mathnasium and three years providing STEM tutoring online. I specialize in 1:1 tutoring, 
        test prep, and college coaching, helping students build confidence and achieve their 
        academic goals. Beyond tutoring, I am skilled in several programming languages, hardware 
        development and testing, general engineering, app development, trading algorithms, robotics,
        computer science, physics, math, business management, and language arts. Passionate about 
        both education and technology, I also enjoy projects on the side, like this tutoring 
        business, and believe in sharing the knowledge I have gained with younger students. Dedicated 
        to problem-solving and continuous learning, I am committed to making a lasting impact.
