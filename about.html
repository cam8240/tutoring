        <p>
          Hi, I'm Cameron! I am a senior at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, majoring in 
          Computer Engineering with a minor in the Hoeft Technology & Management Program. With a 
          strong background in both technical and educational roles, I have interned at Northrop 
          Grumman as a Software Systems Engineer, focusing on automation, data analysis, and system 
          simulations. I have over five years of tutoring experience, including two years at 
          Mathnasium and three years providing STEM tutoring online.
        </p>

        <p>
          I specialize in 1:1 tutoring, test prep, and college coaching, helping students build 
          confidence and achieve their academic goals. Beyond tutoring, I am skilled in several 
          programming languages, hardware development, general engineering, app development, trading 
          algorithms, robotics, physics, business management, and language arts. Passionate about 
          both education and technology, I enjoy side projects like this tutoring business and believe 
          in sharing knowledge with younger students. Dedicated to problem-solving and continuous 
          learning, I am committed to making a lasting impact.
        </p>
